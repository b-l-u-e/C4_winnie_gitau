# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Task 1: Create new React project using Vite

1: Set up basic react application using Vite or similar tool

2: Name of project 'hello world'

3: After installation got to SRC folder and locate your App.jsx file.

4: Remove all HTML (JSX) under the return statement and add; a: H1 tag with 'Hello world' as its content; b: Paragraph which says 
 ‘I am [your full name], this is my first React application.’ 

5: Create github repo and name it C4_your_name and publish your new react project to the repo

### Task 2: Create basic static component

1: Using JSX, create a component that renders a simple user portfolio page that displays your full name, educational background, professional background and skills.

2: Replace the paragraph that displays, ‘I am your full name, and this is my first react application’ with the required content mentioned above.

3: Update your GitHub repo with the new content added to your project.
